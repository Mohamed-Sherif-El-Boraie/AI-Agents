93,Linux,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux,"**Linux** (/ˈlɪnʊks/ *LIN-uuks*) is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel ""Kernel (operating system)"") first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution (distro), which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries ""Library (computing)"")—most of which are provided by third parties—to create a complete operating system, designed as a clone of Unix and released under the copyleft GPL license. The Linux kernel was designed by Linus Torvalds, following the lack of a working kernel ""Kernel (operating system)"") for GNU, a Unix-compatible operating system made entirely of free software that had been undergoing development since 1983 by Richard Stallman.",2025-10-23 10:54:48

For example, [optical character recognition (OCR](https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/ocr)) uses AI to extract text and data from images and documents, turns unstructured content into business-ready structured data, and unlocks valuable insights. [Deep learning](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-deep-learning), a further specialization, utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers to process information, mimicking the structure and function of the human brain. Machine learning is a [subset of artificial intelligence](https://cloud.google.com/learn/artificial-intelligence-vs-machine-learning) that uses algorithms to train data to obtain results. *   [See all AI and machine learning products](https://cloud.google.com/products?pds=CAE#ai-and-machine-learning) *   [Data Analytics](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/data-analytics-and-ai)",2025-10-23 09:22:57
